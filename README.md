Development of a website to show my Curriculum Vitae. 

PROJECT ANALYSIS

User profile:
My ideal user is an HR manager who works in a technology company and is looking for computer engineers. This person values candidades who has technical knowledge (that has studies) and also a person that shows initiative and desire to learn and grow in the sector. This user has a lot of CVs to read so he prefers websites that are easy to read and navigate. He tends to focus on the most relevant sections as education or profile and skills, so he appreciates a website that is well structured and gives clear information. The main goal of my ideal user is to find a qualified and motivated candidate to join the company. He also gets frustrated when important details like contact information is hard to find.  

Information architecture:

The information on the website is organized in a clear way, to make it easy for the users to find what they need. The page structure is divided into sections such as Profile and Skills, Profesional objective, Profesional experience, Education, Languages, and Contact. Each section is separated from the others with enough space and clear titles, so the user can understant in which part of de website are. 

The website is a single page, where the user can scroll or use the menu that jumps to specific sections. This structure helps the users to move through the content easily. 

The layout uses a visual hierarchy, the most relevant details, like the candidate's name and the title apears first. Next come the sections with the information, which follows the same style to keep the consistency of the website. First, it comes personal information such as Personal Skills and Objectives, and then other information such as Studies, Professional experience, or Languages. At the end, there is contact information, which appears after the user has read all the information, in case they want to contact you.
This architecture provides a good reading experience for the users, allowing them to find quickly the key information. 

Visual design:

The website uses a color palette tones of beige, purple and white to keep the readability. The visual design of the website focuses on keeping everything clean, organized and easy to read. The goal was to create calm and a balanced atmosphere, avoiding too many colors that could distract the user. Ii is used similar tones to keep the consistency and prevent the reader from feeling overwhelmed and see a chaotic website. 
Each section is surrounded by a beige box that separates it from the others. This makes it easy for the users to understant where one sections begins and ends, this improves readability.
The most important titles are bigger than the rest of the text and share the same colors between them, so the user can recognize them. 
Overall, the website has been designed to be simple and professional, allowing the user to concentrate on the information and give a feeling of professionalism and control.
